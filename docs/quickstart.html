      <h2>Quick Start</h2>
      <p>
        Typically, the <em>assistant</em> is communicating with the <em>assisted</em> using Jitsi, the phone,
        their favorite IM, or whatever tool they like. Then starting Dayon! allows for watching live the
        <em>assisted</em> computer screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this documentation, the screenshot show the English localisation of the app.
        The application itself is also completely localised in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Turkish and Chinese (simplified).
        It will fall back to English, if the configured user language is none of the above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Caution:</strong> This documentation refers to the most recent program version.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>

      <h2>Preparing & Connecting</h2>

      <h3><img src="assistant.png" alt="Assistant"/>&nbsp;<a id="assistant-setup" class="no">Set up the Assistant computer</a></h3>

      <p>
        Dayon! Assistant is acting as a typical server application (the <em>assisted</em> is going to connect to) and as
        such you've to configure your network to make it visible from the outside world.<br/><br/>
        By default, the server listens to <strong>Port</strong> 8080, but you can change this if necessary.
        Since version 12, Dayon! creates a corresponding port forwarding rule independently. The prerequisite for this
        is that <strong>UPnP</strong> is activated.
        Otherwise, it will still be necessary to forward the port (TCP) via <strong>NAT</strong> on the
        <strong>router</strong> to the corresponding computer.
        <br/><br/>
        Check out <a href="https://portforward.com/router.htm">portforward.com</a> for a step-by-step guide for the most
        common router models.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Optional:</strong> Adjust port for incoming connections: (on the left with UPnP, on the right without)
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_network_settings_upnp.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Network Settings with UPnP"/>
        <img src="assistant_network_settings_noupnp.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Network Settings without UPnP"/>
      </p>

      <h3>Generate and copy token</h3>

      <p>
        Generate an access token by clicking on the key:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_create_token.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Create Token"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Copy the generated access token to the clipboard with a click of the mouse:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_copy_token.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Copy Token"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's it - communicate this <strong>Token</strong> to the <em>assisted</em> via mail, IM or phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>For the impatient:</strong> <a href="#assistant-start">Here</a> you'll learn, how to make the
        <em>assistant</em> <a href="#assistant-start">listening for incoming connections</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Alternative: connect without token</h3>

      <p>
        If you don't want to generate an access token, you have to determine which <strong>IP address</strong> you want
        to share with the <em>assisted</em> to connect to the <em>assistant</em>; you should typically use your
        <strong>public</strong> IP address.<br/>
        But for testing within your local network you might want to use a different one. You can retrieve your
        <strong>public IP address</strong> by clicking the network button:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_network_addresses.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Network IP Addresses"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see on the following picture, the menu contains an item to copy to the clipboard the actual
        <strong>IP Address & Port Number</strong>. It is then easy to <strong>paste it into a chat session</strong>
        (e.g., Jitsi) or into an email.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_network_addresses_ex.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant: Network IP Address Actions"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Note that this IP address is not required by the assistant application as it is listening on all the
          available network interfaces; but you need to communicate it to the assisted. (more on this later).
        </em>
      </p>

      <h3>Press play</h3>

      <p>
        <a id="assistant-start" class="no">
          After a click on the play button (the first from left) the <em>assistant</em> is ready to accept incoming connections:
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_start.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Start"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now you can ask the <em>assisted</em> to connect. You'll be shortly prompted to accept the incoming connection:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_incoming_connection.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Incoming Connection"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        You are now connected to the remote computer and can see its desktop. Be sure to compare the certificate fingerprints of
        the <em>assistant</em> and the <em>assisted</em> computer.<br/>
        <strong>Caution:</strong> If they do not match, the connection is not trustworthy!
      </p>

      <p>
        <br/>
      </p>

      <h3><img src="assisted.png" alt="Assisted"/> &nbsp;<a id="assisted-setup" class="no">Set up the Assisted computer</a></h3>

      <p>
        Dayon! Assisted is acting as a client application calling the outside world and as such there's no network configuration to set up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Download and install the Dayon! application. Then start the <em>Dayon! Assisted</em> application and click the "play" button.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assisted_ready.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assisted : Ready"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter the token communicated by the <em>assistant</em> and acknowledge with OK:<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assisted_token.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assisted : Token"/><br/>
        (if you have already connected to this <em>assistant</em> recently, then you can leave the field empty)
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Alternative variant (connect without token):</h3>
        Enter both the IP address and the port number as communicated by the <em>assistant</em> confirm with OK:
        <br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assisted_network.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assisted : Network"/>
        <br/>
        (both input fields can be cleared by double-clicking them)
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll then be shortly connected to the <em>assistant</em> that is monitoring your screen. Enjoy!
        <br/><br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_connected.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Running"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you are unable to connect by following the instructions above, you should check that you have the right <a href="settings.html">settings</a>.
      </p>


      <h2>Managing the session</h2>

      <p>
        If the desktop of the <em>assisted</em> doesn't fit into your window, it can be scaled down:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_fit_screen.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistent : Fit Screen Toggle"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        By clicking on the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetGal/Dayon/master/src/main/resources/images/100/lock_open.png" alt="open lock"/> button to the right,
        you can maintain the aspect ratio of the <em>assisted</em> screen. Please note that this function has no effect on the display when the window is maximized.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default, the remote <strong>control mode</strong> is off; you can switch it on and off using the
        following icon:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_control.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Control Toggle"/>
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h3>Clipboard transfer</h3>
      <p>
        By clicking on the up- or down button, the clipboard of the assistant
        can either be transferred to the assisted (up) or the clipboard of the
        assisted to the assistant (down).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_clipboard.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistent : Clipboard transfer"/>
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Currently supported are:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Text:</strong> Select text locally or in the assisted window, copy (<code>Ctl + c</code>),
          click up or down. Subsequently, the transmitted text can be inserted in a local or remote application
          (<code>Ctrl + v</code>).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Files:</strong> Select one or more files locally or in the window of the
          <em>assisted</em> person (<code>Ctl + c</code>), click up or down. Subsequently, the file(s) can be
          inserted at the destination.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Graphic:</strong> If the clipboards content is a graphic, for example after taking a screenshot -
          just click up or down. The clipboard containing the graphic can then be used at the destination.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>
      <h3>Send a Windows or Cmd key press</h3>
      <p>
        To send the press of the <strong>*</strong>Windows key, click the Windows button in the <em>assistants</em> control panel:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_windows_key.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistent : Windows Key"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        The key remains pressed until you click the button again. This allows you to send Windows key shortcuts.
        <br/>
        If you need for example to minimize all windows on the <em>assisted</em> side, you would click the Windows
        button, press the <code>M</code> key and then click the Windows button again.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>*Note:</strong> If the <em>assisted</em> is running on macOS, the <code>Cmd</code> key/button is displayed/transferred instead.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h3>Send a Ctrl key press</h3>
      <p>
        While most of the time, the <code>Ctrl</code> key gets transmitted to the <em>assisted</em> like any other keystroke,
        there are situations where it's not. For example the combination <code>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</code> is generally
        "captured" by the <em>assistant</em>s operating system and thus not transmitted.
        On such occasions the <code>[Ctrl]</code> button next to the Windows button in the <em>assistants</em> control panel becomes handy.
        The behaviour is the same as with the Windows button: the key remains pressed until you click the button again.
        <br/>
        So for sending the <code>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</code> combination to the <em>assisted</em>, you have to click the <code>[Ctrl]</code> button first,
        then press the <code>Alt</code> and <code>Delete</code> keys together, release them and finally click the <code>[Ctrl]</code> button again.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Caution:</strong> Due to restrictions of the operating system, the combination <code>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</code>
        does <strong>not work</strong> on <em>assisted</em> that run under Windows! Instead, use the combination <code>Windows + R</code>
        which provides similar functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>Take a screenshot at the assisted</h3>
      <p>
        Click the "Camera" button - the screenshot will be taken directly without further questions.
        The captured graphic ends up in the clipboard of the <em>assisted</em>, from where it can be transferred to the <em>assistant</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="assistant_take_screenshot.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistent : Take screenshot"/>
      </p>

      <h3>Reset screen capture</h3>
      <p>
        The reset screen capture (trash bin icon) resets the capture interval (tick) to the configured one,clears all cached screen data and reloads a new screen capture from assisted.
      </p>

      <h3>Start an online meeting to chat face to face</h3>
      <p>
        Click on the certificate fingerprints on both <em>assisted</em> and <em>assistant</em> to start a joint online meeting in Jitsi.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="dayon_start_chat.jpg" alt="Dayon! start chat"/>
      </p>

      <h3>Statistics Counters</h3>

      <p>
          <img src="stats_counters.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Statistics"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        The status bar of the assistant frame is displaying, in addition to the keyboard layout, the following counters:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Network Bandwidth</li>
        <li>
          Compression Ratio: how many times the initial capture (diff only) has been compressed
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of Tiles: the number of tile being transmitted over the network as well as the cache hits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of Skipped Capture: the number of screen captures that have
          been skipped because of a too high rate (i.e., low tick value) for
          the CPU. To minimize that number you have to slow down the capture
          rate using a bigger tick value.
        </li>

        <li>
          Number of Merged Capture: the number of screen captures that have
          been merged before being transmitted. This is due to a capture rate
          too high for the current compression method. To minimize that number
          you have to slow down the capture rate and/or change the compression
          method using a faster one.
        </li>

        <li>Memory usage</li>
        <li>Duration of the active or the last support session</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        That's all folks! You can find more information on the <a href="settings.html">settings</a> page.
