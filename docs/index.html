      <h2>Remote Assistance Service</h2>
      <div id="intro">
        <p>
          Dayon! is an open-source and cross-platform (JAVA) solution that
          allows watching and controlling a remote computer. In this sense, it
          is very much similar to existing remote desktop solutions.
        </p>
         <p>But I guess it's got some features that makes it valuable.
           You'll find more details in the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start</a> section.
         </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <div id="features">
        <h3><img src="check.png" alt="Check mark" width="16" height="16"/> Easy Setup</h3>
        <p>
          Dayon! is dedicated to people who are quite new in the computer
          world. There's no need to set up the network (i.e., no firewall
          setup, no router configuration, no NAT setup) on their computer.
          Dayon! is acting there as a client connecting to the monitoring
          computer.
        </p>

        <h3><img src="check.png" alt="Check mark" width="16" height="16"/> Low Network Bandwidth</h3>
        <p>
          Dayon! is sending compressed and cached gray (up to 256 levels)
          pictures to minimize the network usage offering as much as possible
          a real-time experience over the Internet. Those pictures are far
          enough for monitoring and explaining the different menus, icons and
          discovering the computer setup, etc...
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Status (15)</h2>
      <p>
        Since release 1.9 (Promiscuous Potato), a portable "quick launch"
        version is available in addition to the conventional installation
        program. There are two separate "quick launch" Windows binaries, one
        for the assisted and one the assistant. They are called "quick
        launch", because they allow the assisted or assistant part to be run
        without prior installation (require the presence of an JRE, however).
        They are 100% compatible with the conventional Dayon! Versions.
        Since release 12 (Adorable Asteroid), similar portable versions are
        available for Linux as well. Since release 15 (Dolly Double) the remote desktop can also be viewed in colors.
        <br/><br/>
        Due to the lack of Apple hardware, the clipboard transfer feature
        could only be tested with Windows 10 and 11, Debian and Ubuntu - Feedback
        from macOS users would be very welcome!
      </p>

      <h2>Rational</h2>
      <p>
        Marc Polizzi has developed Dayon! when he was living in the
        Philippines and was communicating with his family and friends back in
        Europe over Skype.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn't want them to set up their firewall, DSL/cable router and NAT
        and whatever else required for him to access their computer over a remote
        desktop connection. So he decided to implement something very simple in
        his spare time while also considering a low-bandwidth, high-latency network.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several years later, I found this program on
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dayonhome">Sourceforge</a>
        when I was looking for free cross-platform remote assistance solution.
        While using Dayon! to assist users running Windows 7 and later, I
        realised that it had some serious flaws. As the latest version (1.2)
        has been released back in early 2009, I decided to contact the author.
        With his consent I moved the source code of the project to
        <a href="https://github.com/retgal/dayon">GitHub</a>
        in late 2016 and took over the further development.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the way, Dayon! means "Come in!" in Visayas - a local Philippine dialect.
