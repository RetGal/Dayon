			<h2>Remote Assistance Service</h2>
			<div id="intro">
				<p>Dayon! is an open-source and cross-platform (JAVA) solution that allows for watching and controlling a remote computer. In this sense, it is therefore very much similar to existing remote desktop solutions.
				<p>But I guess it's got some features that makes it valuable.
				<p>
					You'll find more details on this <a href="quickstart.html">page</a>.
			</div>
			<h2>Features</h2>
			<div id="features">
				<h3>
					<img src="check.png" alt=""> Easy Setup
				</h3>
				<p>Dayon! is dedicated to people who are quite new in the computer world. There's no need to setup the network (i.e., no firewall setup, no router configuration, no NAT setup) on their computer. Dayon! is acting there as a client connecting to the
					monitoring computer.
				<h3>
					<img src="check.png" alt=""> Low Network Bandwidth
				</h3>
				<p>Dayon! is sending compressed and cached gray (up to 256 levels) pictures to minimize the network usage offering as much as possible a real-time experience over the Internet. Those pictures are far enough for monitoring and explaining the
					different menus, icons and discovering the computer setup, etc...

			<h2>Status (1.5)</h2>
			<p>Release 1.5 (Pendragon) is the first version of Dayon! that has been adapted and tested for/with OS X/macOS (El Capitan & High Sierra).
			<h2>Rational</h2>
			<p>Marc Polizzi has developed Dayon! when he was living in the Philippines and was communicating with his family and friends back in Europe over Skype.
			<p>He did not wanted them to setup their firewall and DSL/cable router and NAT and whatever required so that he could access their machine using a remote desktop connection. So, he decided to implement something very simple in my his free time and
				at the same time take into account a low bandwidth and high latency network.
			<p>
				Several years later, I found this program on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dayonhome">Sourceforge</a> when I was looking for free cross-platform remote assistance solution. While using Dayon! to assist users running Windows 7 and later, I
				realised that it had some serious flaws. As the latest version (1.2) has been released back in early 2009, I decided to contact the author. With his permission I moved the source code of the project over to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in
				the late 2016.
			<p>I updated the used libs to newer versions, did some refactoring on the code, fixed some issues and created a new installer for the Windows platform. Since version 1.4, the communication between the assistant and the assisted is encrypted.
			<p>By the way, Dayon! means "Come in!" in Visayas - a local Philippine dialect.
