        <h2>Remote Assistance Service</h2>
        <div id="intro">
            <p>Dayon! is an open-source and cross-platform (JAVA) solution that allows watching and controlling a
               remote computer. In this sense, it is very much similar to existing remote desktop solutions.
            <p>But I guess it's got some features that makes it valuable.
            <p>You'll find more details on this <a href="quickstart.html">page</a>.
        </div>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <div id="features">
            <h3>
                <img src="check.png" alt=""> Easy Setup
            </h3>
            <p>Dayon! is dedicated to people who are quite new in the computer world. There's no need to setup the
                network (i.e., no firewall setup, no router configuration, no NAT setup) on their computer. Dayon! is
                acting there as a client connecting to the monitoring computer.
            <h3>
                <img src="check.png" alt=""> Low Network Bandwidth
            </h3>
            <p>Dayon! is sending compressed and cached gray (up to 256 levels) pictures to minimize the network usage
                offering as much as possible a real-time experience over the Internet. Those pictures are far enough for
                monitoring and explaining the different menus, icons and discovering the computer setup, etc...
        </div>
        <h2>Status (11)</h2>
        <p>Since release 1.9 (Promiscuous Potato), a portable "quick launch" version is available in addition to the
            conventional installation program. There are two separate "quick launch" Windows binaries, one for the assisted
            and one the assistant.
            They are called "quick launch", because they allow the assisted or assistant part to be run without prior
            installation. They are 100% compatible with the conventional Dayon! Versions.
            <br><br>
            Due to the lack of Apple hardware, the clipboard transfer feature could only be tested with Windows 10,
            Debian and Ubuntu - Feedback from Mac OS users would be very welcome!
        <h2>Rational</h2>
        <p>Marc Polizzi has developed Dayon! when he was living in the Philippines and was communicating with his family
            and friends back in Europe over Skype.
        <p>He did not wanted them to setup their firewall and DSL/cable router and NAT and whatever required so that he
            could access their machine using a remote desktop connection. So, he decided to implement something very
            simple in his free time and
            at the same time take into account a low bandwidth and high latency network.
        <p>
            Several years later, I found this program on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dayonhome">Sourceforge</a>
            when I was looking for free cross-platform remote assistance solution. While using Dayon! to assist users
            running Windows 7 and later, I realised that it had some serious flaws.
            As the latest version (1.2) has been released back in early 2009, I decided to contact the author.
            With his consent I moved the source code of the project over to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
            in late 2016.
        <p>I updated the used libs to newer versions, did some refactoring on the code, fixed some issues and created a
            new installer for the Windows platform. Since version 1.4, the communication between the assistant and the
            assisted is encrypted.
        <p>By the way, Dayon! means "Come in!" in Visayas - a local Philippine dialect.
