        <h3>Known Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There's currently no way to send certain key combinations to the
            assisted computer (e.g.,<code>Ctrl-Alt-Del</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideally, the computers of the assistant and the assisted use both
            the same input language. Using different keyboard layouts can lead
            to problems, especially when entering special characters. The
            keyboard layout in use can be seen in the title bar of the
            respective application.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dayon! Home Directory</h3>
        <p>
          The directory <code>.dayon</code> is created within the default home directory of the logged-in user or
          within the directory referenced by the JAVA property <code>user.home</code> and contains the saved user
          preferences and default log file(s).
        </p>

        <h3>CRC Checksum</h3>
        <p>
          On the assisted side, the screen is divided into different areas
          called <em>tiles</em>. Only tiles that have changed from the previous capture are sent over
          the network to the assistant side. To determine if a tile is different
          I'm currently computing a CRC code (i.e., a unique integer value representing the pixels of the tile)
          that is not perfect for the sake of speed. So it might happen that some <em>changed</em>
          tiles are not sent to the assistant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until now I've detected that issue during strong testing for very few
          pixels. Visually, I've not noticed anything serious. But in case
          things are going mad you can then restart the assisted or before try
          the <code>reset</code> action (<strong>trash bin icon</strong>)
          that should clear every cached data and resend a full screen capture
          from scratch.
        </p>

        <h3>Statistics Counters</h3>
        <img src="stats_counters.jpg" alt="Dayon! Assistant : Statistics"/>
        <p>
          The status bar of the assistant frame is displaying a set of counters.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Network Bandwidth</li>
          <li>
            Compression Ratio: how many times the initial capture (diff only) has been compressed
          </li>
          <li>
            Number of Tiles: the number of tile being transmitted over the network as well as the cache hits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Number of Skipped Capture: the number of screen captures that have
            been skipped because of a too high rate (i.e., low tick value) for
            the CPU. To minimize that number you have to slow down the capture
            rate using a bigger tick value.
          </li>

          <li>
            Number of Merged Capture: the number of screen captures that have
            been merged before being transmitted. This is due to a capture rate
            too high for the current compression method. To minimize that number
            you have to slow down the capture rate and/or change the compression
            method using a faster one.
          </li>

          <li>Memory usage</li>
          <li>Duration of the active or the last support session</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Certificate fingerprints</h3>
        <p>
          To prevent "men in the middle" attacks, the certificate fingerprints of the two connecting sides are displayed.
          The two fingerprints must match - if they don't, then something strange is going on.
          This additional security feature was introduced with version 13 of Dayon!.

          <strong>Caution</strong>: To ensure connection with older clients, the compatibility mode
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetGal/Dayon/master/src/main/resources/images/compatibility.png" alt="compatibility"/> needs to be activated.
