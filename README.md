Dayon! is an easy to use, cross-platform remote desktop assistance solution.

It consists of two parts - one for the assistant and one for the assisted. Both are included in one single package.
As quick launch versions for Windows, they are also available as individual binaries and as snap for various linux distributions.

## Key features

- easy setup (no router or network configuration needed on the assisted side)
- intuitive, multilingual user interface (de, en, es, fr, it, ru, tr, zh)
- assistant and assisted functionality in one package
- secure, encrypted communication (TLS)
- very low bandwidth usage
- cross-platform
- open source
- free (as hugs)

## History

Dayon! was originally developed by Marc Polizzi back in 2008.

With his consent, I have taken over the maintenance and further development of this software in late 2016.
I also moved the code base to GitHub, where it can easier be maintained.

## Releases

The ![latest version](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/releases) is v12.0 (Adorable Asteroid) - released more than ten years after the initial release.

This version comes with UPnP support for the assistant side. If enabled, the port forwarding rules will be created automatically.

The app is available directly from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PBM5KW0C790">Microsoft Store</a>:

## Contributors
 
Any feedback and contributions are very welcome. 

You don't have to be a programmer!

For example translations for additional languages would make this app more useful for more earthlings - see: [src/main/resources/Babylon.properties](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/blob/master/src/main/resources/Babylon.properties) or [docs](https://github.com/RetGal/Dayon/tree/master/docs)

Also improvements of the existing translations and documentation are very welcome! For example, my current knowledge of Chinese is far below zero - and my knowledge of Russian or Turkish just fractions better..

Some additional testing, especially on macOS would also be highly appreciated.
