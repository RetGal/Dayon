License: GPL-2.0

 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
 placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
 of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
 program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
 or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
 the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
 translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
 limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
 this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
 restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
 constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
 running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
 as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
 License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
 of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
